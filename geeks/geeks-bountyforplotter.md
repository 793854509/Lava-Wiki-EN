# Overview

Lava recognizes the importance of an open source eco-system as a blockchain project. We encourage an open source, high-performance plotter via our bounty program described on this page.

Please also notice:

•The Lava Foundation will provide financial support for this bounty program, and will regularly publicize the progress to the community.

•The Lava Foundation will conduct rigorous review and testing of the software. Do not intentionally or maliciously harm the user’s 
interests through the software code, including DoS attacks, intentional algorithm vulnerabilities, and backdoor settings.

•Please carefully learn about the technical requirements for the target software. Do not submit existing open source code or code that is significantly weaker than an existing open source software version.

•Please refer to the latest information from Lava’s open source code repository github.com/lavaio on GitHub.
